<p class="faq_question">Where do the pictures on your web site come from?</p>

<p class="faq_answer">The pictures you can see on <a href="http://www.gourdi.net">gourdi.net</a> all have been generated by a computer program I created.</p>
<p class="faq_answer">More precisely, my work is part of what is known as algorithmic art, which, as the same suggests, consists in designing computer algorithms that create aesthetically pleasing images.</p>
<p class="faq_answer">My work more specifically focuses on what could be called creative randomness. Indeed, all the algorithms I have designed require no human input at all. I just push a button and let the machine do the job. This has 2 consequences: I don't know by advance how an image will look like, and 2 images created by my program will never be the same.</p>

<p class="faq_question">I am a programmer, can you tell me more?</p>

<p class="faq_answer">Yep. The program is written in C++. Using only the standard library. And yes: it required a lot of time and work to achieve what you see on <a href="http://www.gourdi.net">gourdi.net</a>.</p>

<p class="faq_question">Is this possible to get some of your pictures in high definition?</p>

<p class="faq_answer">Yes it is. Feel free to <a href="mailto:g.gourdin@gmail.com">contact me</a> to do so. If you want to check the quality of high definition pictures, you can download one <a href="hd-sample01.png">here</a> and another one <a href="hd-sample02.png">here</a>.</p>
